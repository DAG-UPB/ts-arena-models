# Overlay for macOS hosts (Apple Silicon or Intel). Forces amd64 for CUDA-based images when needed.
# Usage: docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.macos.yml up -d
services:
  # timesfm uses a CUDA base image which isn't available for darwin; force linux/amd64 emulation if on Apple Silicon.
  timesfm:
    platform: linux/amd64

  # If other services require a specific platform, set them here similarly.
  # chronos-bolt/moirai-moe/time-moe/moment currently use python:3.12-slim and should work natively.
